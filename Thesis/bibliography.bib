	abstract = {We consider the sparse grid combination technique for regression, which we regard
	as a problem of function reconstruction in some given function space. We use a regularised
	least squares approach, discretised by sparse grids and solved using the so-called
	combination technique, where a certain sequence of conventional grids is employed.
	The sparse grid solution is then obtained by addition of the partial solutions with
	combination co-efficients dependent on the involved grids. This approach shows instabilities
	in certain situations and is not guaranteed to converge with higher discretisation
	levels. In this article we apply the recently introduced optimised combination technique,
	which repairs these instabilities. Now the combination coefficients also depend on
	the function to be reconstructed, resulting in a non-linear approximation method which
	achieves very competitive results. We show that the computational complexity of the
	improved method still scales only linear in regard to the number of data.},

	abstract = {The combination technique has repeatedly been shown to be an effective tool for the approximation with sparse grid spaces. Little is known about the reasons of this effectiveness and in some cases the combination technique can even break down. It is known, however, that the combination technique produces an exact result in the case of a projection into a sparse grid space if the involved partial projections commute. The performance of the combination technique is analysed using a projection framework and the C/S decomposition. Error bounds are given in terms of angles between the spanning subspaces or the projections onto these subspaces. Based on this analysis modified combination coefficients are derived which are optimal in a certain sense and which can substantially extend the applicability and performance of the combination technique.}
